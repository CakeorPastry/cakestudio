And bro This fucking huzz would arrive so late

Yesterday I went tuition early between 4:00pm-4:10pm and I saw a girl sitting there.

Vemeer said, "Wow those who come early for reading"
Mf was reading only tuition papers 🤫
AND BRO THE KEKMA/FUNNY THING IS (to me) MF WAS SUPER LOCKED IN.

**4th April 2025:**

Those who RISC'ed the opportunity AGAIN cuz scared to talk 😈
Ok those who wanna yap THE today thingy and how it's different from 2 days ago but idk if I wanna 💔
v: Just yap anything


My dad's vehicle and that huzz dad vehicle the same Fuckjng color and same uh *type*(?) /company thingy
Those who know one night parked next to each other ts confusing pmo 💔
Ts funny cuz 
Vehicle color same 💔
AND
MY SHIRT AND HER SHIRT WERE THE SAME COLOR TODAY 💔
v: What r the chances
Her dad vehicle color = My dad vehicle color = Her shirt color today = My shirt color today = Maroon = All the same fucking color
*unlike yesterday, smth different happened on 4th April:*

HER DAD DIDN'T WAIT EARLY
Mg was standing there waiting with her bags in the front 💔
Yk when I carry my bag, not on my back, on my front at school during exams, mg was doing that
THE CARRY BAG THINGY FRONT
v: YES \n ZAAAA\n MG


So like, I was standing in position A, and she in position B right? 
Few months ago I once took pics of those two positions 🤫
THOSE WHO STAND NEXT TO THIS RED GATE *(referring to squid game gate)*
Bro this "squid game" True kekma thingy is gone now, the red gate don't got ts anymore...  💔
If it was only me and her I would have approached and talked to her 🤫

BUT some mf class 10 Josephite was also there so I didn't 💔 ~~(A)~~

"Getting an opportunity, easy first day, next day harder, next day harder and harder, finally impossible"
Ahh moment

Nig I reached tuition at 4:10, and I took a peak, and MF SHE WAS STUDYING (ok couldn't talk, it wasn't like the 2 days ago one because there were already a few ppl 💔)
BRO 4:10 IS TOO EARLY FOR HER (THOSE WHO ARRIVE 4:40) 😈 LAIRIK
Ok those who were writing I think
v: Ok bro u need to start aura farming now

I walked in the opposite direction Like further away from her then I turn around (means I wasn't facing at her) and I got bored so I picked up a stone and wanted to throw it in the drains (still water) 🤫 \n When I picked up the stone, ​​​Mf Peter came! And he called me and I turned around
v: What if it splashed (x)
me replying to  x :I threw like a lot of small stones and some big ones and some splashed yesterday 💔(small drops)

v:THIS IS THE REAL LIGMA WHATTS HER NAME THO ~~(ZZZ)~~
Small drops = big bacteria thi😱😱
That is the thing I wanna know I have some theory but not confirmed
v:Ask ur benchmates u gotta be mastermind 🤫 If u ask "yo bro u know her name" They would think that u like her try smth in different way ~~(YYY)~~
v: You need to learn how to rizz

Ok bro so This isn't the first time me ans her clothes matched up like it happened few weeks ago when it first happened I got mf fast heart beat like a jumpscare I told Mikir "ts some jumpscare" (​​​I said in manipuri) So it's js, since then, everytime she entered class using this green path (there's other ways to enter class), and we got same shirt, that mf Mikhiljit would say "this is ur jumpscare" Ok same shirt after like two weeks. 


me replying to ~~(YYY)~~ :

Mf can't even look at the girls row, like when the teacher is standing at the left side, and I look, then basically my eye sight at the girls row a bit right? 
That mf miggerjit would say 
"Why u lookin at the girls AYYYYYYYYY 🥶😏"

LIKE BRO WHAT ?? 
IT'S 2025

me to ~~(ZZZ)~~:
Stupid Theory :
1. Attendance started before she came. 
2. A girl's name was called out, and everyone said "absent" And that was the only name where everyone said absent... Idk if that's the only one but idk. 
3. But few mins later that mf arrived lol (4:40)
4. So for now I'm taking that name as her name. 
But that's just a theory 
The 
🥀
Ok one time she didn't walk through the path (the green one, which was next to me) and her name was present (prolly walked from other Paths out of my sight late while sir was doing attendance Or smth 💔)

 They dumb asl can't be mastermind + idk how 💔. If that Class 10 Josephite dude wasn't there I would have approached and talked to her 💔 But now I'm like if I did approach her tf would I say? Ok. 

Ok. I just remembered smth​​​​ so I was standing far away from her right, mf there was a car next to me THOSE WHO INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS TOLD ME TO OPEN THE DOOR AND I DID, AND IT FUCKING OPENED ​​​​Those who started laughing cuz fucking door wasn't locked and mg huzz looked for like a second and the true ligma part was...there was a man behind the car, he was the owner and after I closed it, I went away and mg got in the car and drove away💔  ~~()~~


**
from v:
