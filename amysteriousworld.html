<DIV ID="level0">
<H3>0. Black & White</H3>
<P>
<B>
This level spawns the player in a white box with a closed gate infront of them. After opening the gate by activating the button next to the gate, the player is greeted with a dark maze.
<BR>
The goal of the player is to go through the maze without getting caught by the entity and reach the exit door. The exit door can be unlocked by taking and using the key which is hanging on the wall on a board, opposite to the exit door.
</B> 
</P>
</DIV>

<DIV ID="level1">
<H3>1. The Laboratory</H3>
<P>
<B>
This level is a small building which may or may not look like a <I>"Science Laboratory"</I><BR>
There are three parts in this level.
<BR>
1. In the first part, the players will have to find a key in one of the 16 rooms or the areas near those 16 rooms and unlock the door with the key.
<BR>
2. In this second part, the entity starts to become hostile. In this part, the players have to find 3 items which can be found in the next 16 rooms or the areas near those 16 rooms. After this, the player has to interact with one of those four big containers which has only the green liquid.
<BR>
3. A cutscene will then play and the players must run to the exit door as soon as possible, before they die due to the leaking green liquid, "acid" and place the item they got from the cutscene on the pedestal which is next to the exit door, wait, then enter the door and exit.
</B> 
</P>
</DIV>

<DIV ID="level2">
<H3>2. The Bridge</H3>
<P>
<B>
The player has 5 minutes to hide in the bunker which is next to the house. The player spawns near a house, facing a tree. On the tree, there's a newspaper which states that a tsunami will happen in 5 minutes in the area where the player spawns and warns everyone to go to a safe place.
The level resets if everyone dies.
</B> 
</P>
</DIV>

<DIV ID="level3">
<H3>3. The What Event</H3>
<P>
<B>
There's nothing to explain here. It's a time consuming level, which you can easily complete by following the instructions in-game. This level makes no sense. Just follow the instructions, don't die, thats all. This level is like those story games where you interact, do quests, etc.
</B> 
</P>
</DIV>

<DIV ID="level4">
<H3>4. The White Box</H3>
<P>
<B>
This level is VERY time consuming. Basically a walking simulator. Just keep walking, pay attention to everything, pay attention to the writings on the walls, don't mess up because you might have to restart the whole level. The level resets if everyone dies. Don't do the, "Seeing is believing" in here, and, hurry up...
</B> 
</P>
</DIV>

<DIV ID="level5">
<H3>5. Glitched</H3>
<P>
<B>
This level is a very dark, huge maze. Can't really give a guide for this one. Just pray that you find the exit and do not encounter the entity. 
As of now, completing this level will give you the
<BR>"Pre-Alpha Ending" Badge.

<H3>Entity AI</H3>

<H4>AI Type 0</H4>
<P>
<B>
This AI is the simplest AI. Once the entity finds a player, it will chase it down till one of the following happens :<BR>
1. The player dies<BR>
2. The entity loses sight of the player<BR>
3. Sometimes due to other reasons.
</B>
</P>

<H4>AI Type 1</H4>
<P>
<B>
This AI is easy to counter. When the entity sees a player, it will stand still for a few seconds and play a sound. After the sound ends, if it finds any player again, it will chase that player till it dies. So to avoid this, simply stay away from the entities sight till the sound ends. If the entity doesn't find anyone after the sound, it continues patrolling and restarts its process of patrolling, finding players, killing players etc.
</B>
</P>

<H4>AI Type 2</H4>
<P>
<B>
If an entity with this AI finds you, its over for you. This AI is the hardest to escape, almost impossible. Once it finds the player, it will keep on chasing it without giving up. It will stop only if the player dies or the entity gets stuck.
</B>
